            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Henry Etuk Junior, and my Altschool ID is ALT/SOE/023/2708. I graduated from Aptech in 2021. I took a robotics program sometime in 2011, and that's when I was first introduced to programming. I liked it, and I've always had a thing for computers. Fast forward to 2020, I started looking for some programming courses. Now I'm in Altschool learning to be a backend engineer.

            <h2>Goals for Altschool</h2>
            <p>
                I want to be able to provide a relevant service/product to companies and individuals that will make life easier for them and in turn make me some good amount of money, and I believe Altschool can equip me with the skills I need to make that a reality. <br>
                I'm also planning to travel out of my current residence, Nigeria, and software engineers are sort after and highly paid in the country which I plan to travel to, so I want to make myself appropriate for that opportunity.
